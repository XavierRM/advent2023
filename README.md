# Advent of code 2023 challenges in OCaml

Each file will contain the resolution of one challenge, corresponding each, to the day the challenge was released.

# Setup

The template directory contains, as it's name states, a template OCaml subproject used to start every challenge.

The tag ```startingpoint``` has a version of the project that is ready to use resolving challenges.

# Build and run

To build one of the subprojects just run something like:

```
dune build template
```

To run the executable, execute the following command:

```
dune exec template
```
